## Introduction

In this post I shall continue the step-by-step breakdown of last week's post on how to make an artwork out of basic shapes. If you missed that, you can read that [here](https://angeldollface.boo/posts/2024-07-13-Basic-shapes-I/). Last week we created a sketch that is now ready to be colored and further modified.

## Coloring and filling

In the next step, I used ProCreate's ink brush to trace the lines of the sketch. The important thing here was that one should attempt to make smooth lines. In other art tutorials, that use any digital art applications, I often get frustrated because the people who make these tutorials never say which brushes they used. This makes it hard for others to follow along. The brush I used is the "Syrup" brush from the "Inking" brushes. To get the color, I used an eyedropper on the original reference image. Once I had done the smooth lineart, I then used ProCreate's colorfill tool to fill in the areas I wanted to fill. Below you can see the result.

## Adding image noise

To give my devil girly a slightly chaotic flair, I then added some noise to her sillhouette. For this I used the "Clipping Mask" feature that ProCreate provides. I added a layer above my filled out shape of my devious doll and turned on the clipping mask feature for it. This feature will only add color onto the shapes colored in the layer below it. I tried a few brushes to add noise but finally went with one of the brushes from the "Artistic" section. I made the shade of the color I had used for filling a bit lighter to add contrast.

## Adding background (noise)

To round the artwork off, I finally made the background completely black and used the same brush from the previous section to add noise with my favourite color, "#EA1573". You can view the final, finished result below.

## Conclusion

This post has been a bit shorter than usual but I have already worked on and prepared a very long post for next week. I tried my best to make that post as exciting and interesting and I hope you will enjoy that one as much as you enjoyed this short and sweet post.
