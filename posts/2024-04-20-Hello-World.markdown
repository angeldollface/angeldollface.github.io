## Hello World!

Hello! This is my first blog post on this shiny, new website. If you do not know who I am, you can find out about that [here](/content/about). The "TL;DR" is that I've been coding for 10 years and know roughly  13 programming languages and I have been making art for roughly half that time.

## The purpose of this website

This site serves many purposes! This site features my blog, my portfolio on art, music, and DJing, and is also my own little corner of the internet. My blog will be featuring posts on any of the following topics: cybersecurity, cyberprivacy, technology, art, and programming One post on any of these subjects will be coming every week on Saturday.

## Social channels

If you would like to stay up-to-date on new content and check out my YouTuibe channel where I will be posting music andf have posted my DJ mixes and will be live-streaming, then you can find the links to the relevant social media channels [here](/content/socials). I post one DJ set every week on Saturday.
