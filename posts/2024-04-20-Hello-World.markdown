## Hello World!

Hello! This is my first blog post on this shiny, new website. If you do not know who I am, allow me to introduce myself a little! I'm an artist, developer, DJ, and creative from Vienna, Austria. Sometimes I'm also a quirky doll. ;)

## The purpose of this website

This site serves many purposes! This site features this blog, my art and code portfolios, links to my weekly DJ sets on my YouTube channel, and soon, some music. Most importantly, however, this website is also my little corner of the internet. My blog will be featuring posts on one of two topics: technology and art. One post on one of these subjects will be coming every week on Saturday.

## Social channels

If you would like to stay up-to-date on new posts, you can follow me on Mastodon [here](https://corteximplant.com/@angeldollface666) or Instagram [here](https://instagram.com/angeldollface666). If you want to follow me on both, you can do that too. The link to my YouTube channel, where I post one DJ set every Saturday, you can find [here](https://youtube.com/@angeldollface666).

## About this website

I programmed this website myself in HTML 5, CSS 3, and Javascript in roughly two days. The code of this website is licensed under the DSL v1 and the content is my own and therefore cannot be used by anyone without my express approval and consent. You can find the license for the code [here](https://github.com/angeldollface/doll-software-license) and the code [here](https://github.com/angeldollface/angeldollface.github.io). The content is managed with a content-management system I wrote myself in Rust and still actively develop and maintain, called *Mandy*. *Mandy* is more or less free and open-source software and licensed under the DSL v1 also. You can find Mandy's GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/angeldollface/mandy).
