## Links to my social media

The list below features all my social-media links. I will attempt to write one single post every week on my blog. In the same way, I upload a DJ-set once a week on my YouTube channel. If you're curious about all the software I've built and would like to use it in whatever capacity, you can read about all the software I've built on my GitHub profile and peruse the source code of any project. If you want to stay up-to-date with new blogposts, software I've built, and new videos, feel free to follow me on Instagram and Sharkey.
