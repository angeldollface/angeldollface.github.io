## Who are you?

I graduated this year from the University of Vienna in English Literature, I write code, I make and mix music, and I make art. I also hang out on Discord every now and again and try to help people. If you want to listen to my mixes, check out my YouTube channel. You can find those links on the "Socials" page. I've also been coding for the past 12 years and I've learned a few things in that time. If you want to view any of the software I've built, you can do so on my GitHub profile. A link to that can also be found on this website's "Socials" page.
