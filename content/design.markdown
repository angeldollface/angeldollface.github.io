## DESIGN

The design of this website was strongly inspired by simple, uncomplicated design. Since blackletter fonts have a certain charm of their own and this aesthetic appeals to me, I decided to use this for headings. Since I also wanted a classical aesthetic for my site, I decided to use a serif font. The overall layout is kept simple and light because I didn't want this site to get bloated like previous iterations.

## IMPLEMENTATION

This site, was built using [Mandy](https://github.com/angeldollface/mandy), a content-management system I built some months ago in Rust (I released v.0.3.4 recently.). If you would like to view the source of this website, you can find the the source at this link: [View source repository](https://github.com/angeldollface/angeldollface.github.io)

## EXPERIMENTS!

Mandy has a feature that lets users use an exisiting Mandy project as a template for new Mandy projects. To use this site as a template for a new project, make sure you have Mandy installed and available from the command line and run this command from a terminal session:

```bash
# Mandy can be installed from this link:
# https://github.com/angeldollface/mandy
mandy -i mysite -w angeldollface/angeldollface.github.io
```
