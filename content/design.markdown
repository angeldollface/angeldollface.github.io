## Design System

The design system used here is a mix of three design systems.

- Version 3.0 of Google's Material Design, *Material You*
- The Kawaii aesthetic from Japanese popular culture
- The *Hacker* aesthetic from websites of the early 90s

*Material You* was used to decide and determine the layout of pages on this site. This includes the size and shape of buttons, bars, and element spacing.

The Kawaii aeshtetic was used to decide upon the typography of headings and other important text on the site. The goal here was to create a cute, warm, and slightly goofy look.

Finally, the monospace font used in all text content, that is not headings or user-experience-critical, was decided upon because it is clean, spacious and very easy to read.

## Implementation

The implementation of this website was carried out using four technologies:

- [HTML 5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)
- [CSS 3](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp)
- [Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp)
- [Mandy](https://angeldollface.art/mandys-house)

The HTMl code determines the structure and the place of an element in the hierarchy of elements on a page. The CSS is the main component used for implementing the layout and design you see on the page. I tried to keep the Javascript used on this website as minimal as possible and Javascript was only used to make the navigation menu work as it does. Mandy is used to control the way content on the site is generated, handled, and rendered.
