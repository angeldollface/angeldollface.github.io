## DESIGN

The design of this website was steongly inspired by Charli XCX's "Break the Rules" schoolbus scene. The scene features her name in messy letters with a reddish, pink shadow sprayed on the headboard of a schoolbus. This inspired the aesthetic of the headings. The monospace font for the main content was used because it is a) readable and b) adds an IT-realted flair to the aesthetic since IT and software engineering is one of my main interests and passions. The overall layout is kept simple and light because I didn't want this site to get bloated like previous iterations.

## IMPLEMNTATION

This site, was built using [Mandy](https://github.com/angeldollface/mandy), a content-management system I built some months ago in Rust (I released v.0.3.4 last week.).
