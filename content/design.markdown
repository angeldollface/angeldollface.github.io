## DESIGN

The design of this website was strongly inspired by the schoolbus scene from Charli XCX's song, "Break the Rules". The scene features her name in messy letters with a reddish, pink shadow sprayed on the headboard of a schoolbus. This inspired the aesthetic of the headings. The monospace font for the main content was used because it a) is readable and b) adds an IT-related flair to the aesthetic since IT and software engineering are one of my main interests and passions. The overall layout is kept simple and light because I didn't want this site to get bloated like previous iterations.

## IMPLEMENTATION

This site, was built using [Mandy](https://github.com/angeldollface/mandy), a content-management system I built some months ago in Rust (I released v.0.3.4 last week.).
