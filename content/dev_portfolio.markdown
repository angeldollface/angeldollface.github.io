## Rust

### Mandy

Mandy is a hypersonic static-site generator written in 100% pure Rust. Mandy provides a single binary for all major platforms and makes building, managing, and shipping your content and your site extremely easy. You can find out more about Mandy and how to get started with Mandy [here](https://github.com/angeldollface/mandy)

## Python

### Shortly

Since people share a lot of links around, I wanted to write a small url-shortening app. Shortly is an app that makes url-shortening easy and runs on Django and Python. You can find out more about Shortly [here](https://github.com/angeldollface/shortly).

## Typescript

### Tron

Most developer portfolios usually have some "three.js" animations on their site and this animation made with Blender and three.js was an early prototype for a "three.js" project to be used for this website. You can find out more about this React-cum-three.js app [here](https://github.com/angeldollface/androfetch). The live and deployed version of this React app can be found [here](https://angeldollface.boo/tron)

## Java (Android)

### Androfetch

The popular Neofetch script by Dylan Araps is very widely used in the customization and Linux community. Since Android could possibly be thought of as a very special Linux distribution and Android didn't really seem to have a Neofetch-like app of its own, I decided to write this app. Androfetch displays similar statistics to those of Neofetch. You can find out more about Androfetch and try it [here](https://github.com/angeldollface/androfetch).

## Dart (Android, Web, iOS, Mac OS)

### Quotly

Quotly is a small Flutter app that fetches quotes from a remote API and displays a famous quote over a pretty picture. Users can copy this quote and use it wherever they wish. You can view the source of this app [here](https://github.com/angeldollface/quotly.dart) together with a live, deployed version of this Vue app on the internet [here](https://angeldollface.boo/quotly.dart/).

## Vue.js

### Ceramic

During my computer science course at university a challenge was set to look up algorithms and implement these algorithms in some way. Since IMEI numbers seemed very interesting, I wanted to make a Vue.js app to validate IMEI numbers users entered. For this, I first wrote a Javascript library and then created a Vue app that validated any IMEI numbers users put in. If the input was invalid, the app would tell them. You can view the source of this app [here](https://github.com/angeldollface/ceramic) together with a live, deployed version of this Vue app on the internet [here](https://angeldollface.boo/ceramic/).

## SASS

### A Mandy Portfolio Site Template

One of the key features of Mandy is that Mandy allows the scaffolding for a new Mandy project from a GitHub repository. Since Mandy is roughly 3000 lines of Rust at this point (v.0.3.4) and the project needed a wide and diverse array of scaffold projects, I developed this project for users of Mandy who wanted to use Mandy to publish their portfolio or an image-heavy blog. You can view the source of this site [here](https://github.com/angeldollface/mandy-portfolio-site) together with a live, deployed version of this Mandy site on the internet [here](https://angeldollface.boo/mandy-portfolio-site)

## SHELL

### Dotfiles

I am a huge fan of customization and after switching to Arch Linux permanently, it took me a long time to find a setup I really liked. My "dotfiles" repository contains all the different setups I have done over time and used on a day-to-day basis. All of the shell scripts (written in Bash) included, I wrote myself to do different specific tasks. The screenshot below showcases my setup with the BSPWM window manager, the Polybar panel, the Alacritty terminal, and my simple Neovim config working on a Rust project of my own. You can view all my setups in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/angeldollface/dotfiles) and you are free to do with the scripts and other configuration files whatever you please!
