## Welcome!

You have reached my official website. This website contains many interesting things. Among these things are: my blog, an overview of some of my work (coming soon), and information on where to connect with me on social media. This website was developed and designed by me using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The site is built using a content-management system that I wrote in Rust some months ago. If you're interested in that, you can check that project out [here](https://github.com/angeldollface/mandy). If you would like to contact me, you can find the links to my social media profiles in the navigation menu.
